# secondtry
This is the second time I learn how to use github after a year of none using it. 
The time has come so that I need to master all the skills which I need for my class. 
Github is also a very useful tool in the job as well
From here to the rest, it was made in the branch which is not the master.
This type of edit after being saved will be called commit.
